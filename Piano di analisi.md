##Analysis Plan


### Exploratory analysis `V`

* barcharts for dose and supp (`r barcharts`) `v`

* univariate graphs on all the population (`r first histogram`) `v`

* biviariate and multivariate box plot (`r conditional boxplots`) `v`


###Data Manipulation `V`


###Statistical analysis

* check for normality of population (graphically) `v`

* performing tests `x`=> i have defined the template for all the tests, performing the first one. it works very well

* creating plots (maybe with a function) related to tests (see http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/probability.html for further help) `v`

* drawing conclusions.

###Review

### Rendering
* plot dimensions `v`
* messages of codes `v`
* pdf rendering bug fixing
